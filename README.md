## Introduction

Welcome to our Hangman game! This project was developed using C++ and the SFML library, offering a fun and interactive way to play the classic word-guessing game with a modern graphical interface.

## Achievements

- Gained knowledge of working with the SFML library
- Gained the experience of working on a team using a low level language
- Developed the main screen with essential buttons: Start, Exit, and Tutorial
- Implemented a scoring system
- Added multiple categories, including Movies, Pop Culture, Music, and more

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- SFML library (version 2.5 or later)

## Installation
